# STAT 520 Seminar: Logistic Regression and Stock Market Prediction

## Project Overview
This seminar project provides a comprehensive introduction to logistic regression and demonstrates its application to financial data analysis. The project uses logistic regression to predict stock market outcomes based on financial indicators and company metrics.

## Project Objectives
1. Explain the theory and methodology of logistic regression
2. Demonstrate practical application using real financial data
3. Evaluate model performance in predicting stock market behavior

## Methodology
